## Things I did not do

- contacts filtration
- contacts search

I could do these tasks on fron-end but because I setup strapi
I couldn't finish on time. Nevertheless, I have the exact example of these tasks.

## Warning !

if you have any troubleshooting while registration or login in project
it's because of back-end register admin panel
my back-end code was deployed on render.com 
and render.com regularly cleans the cache.
